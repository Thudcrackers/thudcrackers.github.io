            <p style="width: 26em; font-size: 18px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Monster Lands is a web comic by James Nelson. "Monster Lands is a fantasy/dramedy
            story that focuses on the axe-wielding, monster-riding adventurer Othera as she 
            battles against the tyranny of the evil queen Eren Lorry! 
            Itâ€™s largely a character-driven story, written as sort of a deconstruction of 
            fantasy tropes while also being a love letter to the genre. It is made of numerous 
            short, standalone chapters which form the base for the longer, plot-intensive 
            chapters."</p>
