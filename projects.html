        <p class="has-text-left">
            Beerate is a PWA with the goal of helping people find beers they might like, based on their own ratings.<br>
            The goal is not for people to go see what ratings a beer has gotten, but to say whether or not they liked a beer, and get suggestions based on those preferences.<br>
            Eventually, I want to branch out to help people learn about the process of making beer, why different beers taste different, and more.<br>
            This will also include a dashboard view for breweries that they can use to see details about their beer on the platform.

        <p class="has-text-left">
            Beerate's front end is built in Nuxt, a framework based on Vue. The API is built in Ruby on Rails, and the database is PostgreSQL.

            The Hall of Fame Network aims to bring people to halls and walks of fame that they would otherwise not know about.
            Browse through many different halls, sort by type, state, or all, and discover what is near you, or plan your next road trip.

            HOF Network is built with Ruby on Rails, using Bulma as a CSS framework. Currently the back and front end are both Ruby on Rails, with plans to move the front end
            to Vue in the future.

            "Twilite" is a (sort of) Twitter clone, built in React. It is not funcitonal, I just made it to mess around with React components. Twilite uses the Bulma CSS framework for the UI.
