    <p id="homeBody" style="font-size: 16px"><span class="icon"><i class="fab fa-google"></i></span> I am a graduate of Lenoir-Rhyne University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
        I love everything to do with computers, and I am always learning new things. Right now I am a Fiber Optic Design Engineer at UC Synergetic, 
        but programming is my passion and I can't wait to get a job in it.
        I am currently enrolled in Udacity's Web Development nanodegree program, and I hope to continue to learn and become better.</p>
