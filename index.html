    I am a graduate of Lenoir-Rhyne University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
    I love everything to do with computers, and I am always learning new things.

    Currently, I am building a site that aims to bring people to new halls of fame across the country, and updating the site for a 
    fantastic local brewery. You can see both of these projects over on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.
